<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is **Ziyu Song**. I am an Assistant Professor at Jilin University. My research focuses on building safe, robust, and generalizable **autonomous driving systems**, with emphasis on:

- Vision–Language–Action models for driving
- Data-driven decision-making and planning
- Vehicle dynamics & robust control
- Preference-based reinforcement learning and cognitive intelligence
- Safety-critical driving in complex, real-world scenarios

I obtained my Ph.D. in Automotive Engineering at Jilin University under Prof. <font color=Gray>Haitao Ding</font>, and conducted joint doctoral research at Nanyang Technological University under Prof. <font color=Gray>Chen Lv</font>. I am currently collaborating with Prof. <font color=Gray>Yunfeng Hu</font> and Prof. <font color=Gray>Hong Chen</font> on research topics related to autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems.
Prior to academia, I worked at FAW Group as an engineer.
